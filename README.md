# Hyxlishious

hey i'm Hyxlishious. i'm a highschooler that does things mostly online but also irl.

i started programming in 2019, mostly creating roblox games, but from there i've also moved out into other spaces like minecraft datapacks, trash AI's similar to chatgpt to an extent, trying to use blender's built in coding stuff, programming arduinos and other chips for stuff, etc. i'm much better as a musician and music producer if imma be real. while i've only taken a single class into computer science, i'm already quite skilled and learning by myself everyday. i still mainly do coding work on roblox, especially my most recent game, which is also my biggest project.

remember to eat your veggies

bye bye
